Go through the code once over, and clean up comments among others.

Also double check instructions implemented and not.

And no privilege checks as of yet.

Thread shutting down seems to sometimes cause segfault when sending a kill signal.
Probably doing thread shutting down to quickly or need to wait on a thread I dont do now.

fix mopc command parsing

fix mon call in/out since we use a totally different in/out code now.

fix mopc out to check so we dont do a buffer overrun
