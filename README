The binary will run .bp format files, as well as stripped bpun files.
all configuration of start parameters is done through nd100em.conf file,
see instructions in the example file for examples of how to use it.

To run a particular program copy it first either to test.bpun or test.bp depending
on format, and then set the correct start address in config file.
For example, to run MAC: (start address 173415 octal)
copy NPL.bp to test.bp, and set config file to bp format, and start addess
63245.

Then run emulator with ./nd100em.
